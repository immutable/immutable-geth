# Immutable Geth

Golang execution layer implementation of the Ethereum protocol. Modified for the purposes of the Immutable zkEVM.

All modifications made by Immutable are either contained in files named `*immutable*.go` or have `CHANGE(immutable):` comments above or inside the modified lines of code.

## Build

With Golang 1.20 installed, run:

```
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```
make all
```

The built client binary is `./build/bin/geth`

You can run a local network with your built binary via the `immutable bootstrap local` command:
```
now=$(date +%s)
./build/bin/geth immutable bootstrap local \
--override.shanghai="$now" \
--override.prevrandao="$now" \
--override.cancun="$now"
```

You can run the E2E tests against your built binary via:
```
.github/scripts/bootstrap_test.sh
```

## Docker

The client is distributed as the following Docker image:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/immutable/go-ethereum/go-ethereum:latest
```
