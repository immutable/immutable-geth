## [v0.0.10]

- Always drop peers when find node errors are greater than the threshold

## [v0.0.9]

- Automation / CD updates only. Releasing with latest prod workflows.

## [v0.0.8]

- Added max block range for logs queried using eth_getLogs (#346)
- Default mainnet configuration (`/etc/geth/mainnet.toml`) and genesis (`/etc/geth/mainnet.json`) added to Docker image

## [v0.0.7]

- Automation / CD updates only: immutable init command

## [v0.0.6]

- Automation / CD updates only

## [v0.0.5]

- Reduce price limit 100->10 Gwei

## [v0.0.4]

### Added

- Default testnet configuration (`/etc/geth/testnet.toml`) and genesis (`/etc/geth/testnet.json`) added to Docker image

## [v0.0.3]

### Added

- Add NewRelic agent to geth runtime for application metrics

### Fixed

- Price limit being 100 Gwei rather than 100 Gwei - 1 Wei
- Fixed bug in ACLs that caused transactions to be blocked when they should not have been

## [v0.0.2]

### Changed

- Change to add access control layer to geth legacypool, which safeguards txs
  from entering txpool if the sender is part of a collective SDN list (#17)
- Mempool Rebroadcasting: Legacy pool now rebroadcasts pending transactions
  whenever a pool reorg is triggered. Pool reorgs are triggered when a new block
  is received - (#103)
- Transaction Broadcasting: Transactions are broadcast to all peers, not a
  square root. All peers get the transaction, regardless of whether they may
  have previously received it. All peers get the full transaction payload, i.e.
  no more announcements. (#103)
- Changed `maxUncleDist` from 7 to 0. This means old blocks are rejected,
  reducing chance of reorgs. (#156)
- Changed `maxQueueDist` from 32 to 256. This means more blocks in the future
  can be received without being rejected. This is to account for our increased
  block production due to reduced block time. (#156)
- Changed `blockLimit` from 64 to 256. Since we only have a small amount of
  peers, more will come from the same set of peers, so we need to allow for
  this. (#156)
- Added invariants to prevents reorgs (#175)
- Added check for NoLocals on legacytxpool to reject underpriced TXs
- Changed the `DefaultBaseFeeChangeDenominator` from 8 to 50. This makes the max
  base fee rate of change 2%, instead of 12.5%. With a block time of 2 seconds,
  we match Ethereum in that it would take 72 seconds for the base fee to double.
  (#178)
- Mine a tx even if its effective tipcap (tipcap-basefee) is less than miner's minimum tipcap (which is pricelimit, or 100 gwei) (#258)

### Added

- CLI commands for bootstrapping local and remote Immutable chains
- Added CLI parameter options for the geth immutable bootstraper, which can
  potentially takes in a list of filepaths for blocklists and allowlists (#83)
- Added flags to disable Admin/Txpool/Engine/Debug endpoints on RPC server

### Fixed
