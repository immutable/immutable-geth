# Security Policy

Security vulnerabilities should be disclosed to the project maintainers through our public [immutable bug bounty program](https://bugcrowd.com/immutable-og) or email us at security@immutable.com.

## Security Patches

Security vulnerabilities will be patched as soon as responsibly possible, and published as an advisory on this repository.

## Supported Versions

Please see [Releases](https://github.com/immutable/geth/releases). We recommend using the [most recently released version](https://github.com/immutable/geth/releases/latest).

Security patches will be released for the latest minor of a given major release. For example, if an issue is found in versions >=1.1.0 and the latest is 1.8.0, the patch will be released only in version 1.8.1.

Only critical severity bug fixes will be backported to past major releases.
